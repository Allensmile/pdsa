Probabilistic data structures is a common name of data structures
based on different hashing techniques.

Unlike regular (or deterministic) data structures, they always give you
approximated answers and usually provide reliable ways to estimate
the error probability.

The potential losses or errors are fully compensated by extremely
low memory requirements, constant query time and scaling.
